# General Components (Applicable to all pages)

## Core Principles

- Placeholder images/videos will be used during the initial development phase.
- The social proof section will be populated with placeholder content based on target user personas.

## Header

- **Structure & Layout (Desktop):**
    - **Left:** QualifAI Logo.
    - **Center:** Navigation Menu (Features, Why Us, FAQ).
    - **Right:** Primary CTA ("Analyze Resumes Free").
- **Behavior:**
    - The header must be "sticky," remaining fixed at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls down the page.
- **Navigation Menu Behavior:**
    - **Features:** Clicking this link should navigate to `/#features` and smoothly scroll the user down to the "Features Section" on the Home Page.
    - **Why Us:** Clicking this link should navigate the user to the "Why Us Page" at the URL `/why-us`.
    - **FAQ:** Clicking this link should navigate the user to the "Full FAQ Page" at the URL `/faq`.
- **Responsive Behavior (Mobile - below 768px):**
    - The center navigation menu must collapse into a "Hamburger" icon.
    - When clicked, the Hamburger icon should open a sheet/drawer menu containing the navigation links (Features, Why Us, FAQ) and the primary CTA button ("Analyze Resumes Free").

## Footer

- **Structure & Layout:** The footer should be organized into two main parts:
    - **1. Main Links Section (Multi-column):**
        - **Column 1 (Product):** Features, Why Us, FAQ.
        - **Column 2 (Legal):** Privacy Policy, Terms of Service.
        - **Column 3 (Connect):** Social media icons (LinkedIn is mandatory).
    - **2. Sub-Footer (Single Row):**
        - A concise line stating: `QualifAI is a proud product of WitData and Titani Solutions.`
        - Copyright: `Â© 2025 QualifAI. All rights reserved.`
- **Link Behavior:**
    - The "Features" link should navigate to `/#features`.
- **Trust Elements:**
    - Placeholder for trust badges (e.g., "Data Encrypted") can be included in the main links section.
