# 3. Target User Personas

We focus on three distinct recruiter segments, with the freelance recruiter as our primary user, who will derive the most value from our free, powerful platform.

## 3.1. Primary Persona: The Freelance Recruiter

-   **Name:** Tuan
-   **Role:** Part-time / Freelance Recruiter (Commission-based)
-   **Bio:** Tuan is a dynamic and results-oriented individual who sources recruitment opportunities from job boards and professional networks. He juggles multiple roles across various industries and his income is directly tied to the speed and quality of his candidate submissions.

### Pain Points

-   **No Access to Experts:** Lacks the support of an in-house technical team to verify candidate skills.
-   **High Volume, Low Context:** Must quickly understand the core requirements of diverse and unfamiliar job descriptions.
-   **Resource Constraints:** Cannot afford expensive ATS or premium sourcing tools.
-   **Speed is Critical:** Every moment spent on manual screening is a potential loss of commission.

### Goals

-   To maximize his placement rate and, consequently, his income.
-   To rapidly identify the top 2-3 candidates from a large pool for any given role.
-   To build a reputation for quality and reliability with his clients.

## 3.2. Secondary Persona: The In-House Recruiter

-   **Name:** Maria
-   **Role:** Corporate Recruiter / HR Generalist
-   **Bio:** Maria works within a company and has access to technical hiring managers. However, she wants to be more autonomous and add more strategic value.

### Pain Points

-   **Confidence Gap:** Feels insecure about her own technical knowledge when initially screening candidates.
-   **Inefficient Collaboration:** Wants to reduce the back-and-forth with hiring managers by presenting a better-qualified initial shortlist.
-   **Manual Data Entry:** Wastes time copying information from resumes into the company's HR systems.

### Goals

-   To be a strategic partner to hiring managers, not just an administrative support.
-   To increase her confidence in assessing technical roles.
-   To free up time for more meaningful candidate engagement.

## 3.3. Secondary Persona: The Agency Recruiter

-   **Name:** David
-   **Role:** Senior Recruiter at a Headhunting Firm
-   **Bio:** David is an experienced headhunter with a strong network. His reputation and success depend on his ability to understand niche roles and present exceptional candidates that clients can't find themselves.

### Pain Points

-   **High Stakes:** A bad submission can damage his reputation with a valuable client.
-   **Lack of Deep Specialization:** Often works on highly specialized roles outside his core area of expertise.
-   **Global Talent Pool:** Deals with resumes in multiple languages and formats, complicating evaluation.

### Goals

-   To increase his placement rate for hard-to-fill technical roles.
-   To solidify his status as a trusted expert advisor to his clients.
-   To reduce the time spent vetting candidates who are a poor technical fit.
