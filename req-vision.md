3. Target User Persona
Name: Maria
Role: Recruiter / HR Generalist
Pain Points:
Spends hours trying to decipher highly technical job descriptions (JDs) filled with unfamiliar jargon.
Lacks the deep technical expertise to confidently assess whether a candidate's skills truly match complex role requirements.
Juggles 5-10 different technical roles at once, making it difficult to keep candidate pools and requirements for each role separate and organized.
Wastes time manually copying and pasting information like name, email, phone number from a PDF resume into an Excel file or ATS.
Receives resumes from candidates globally in many different languages, making screening a slow and challenging process.
Goal:
