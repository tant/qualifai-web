## 2.0 VISUAL DESIGN & BRANDING GUIDELINES

### 2.1. Typography

- **Primary Font:** Inter. This font must be used for all text content, including headings, subheadings, and body text, to ensure readability and a modern aesthetic.
- **Headings (H1, H2):** Use Inter Bold.
- **Subheadings (H3, H4) & Emphasized Text:** Use Inter SemiBold.
- **Body Text:** Use Inter Regular.

### 2.2. Color Palette

- **Primary Color (Deep Blue):** `#0A2540`. To be used for core branding elements, dark backgrounds, and primary text to convey trust and professionalism.
- **Accent Color (Vibrant Green):** `#00C853`. Must be used for all primary Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons and interactive elements that require user attention (e.g., links, icons for success states). This color signifies action, growth, and success.
- **Neutral Colors:**
    - **White (#FFFFFF):** Primary background color for a clean, spacious feel.
    - **Light Gray (#F6F9FC):** For secondary backgrounds, cards, and section dividers to create subtle visual hierarchy.
    - **Charcoal Gray (#333333):** For all body text to ensure optimal readability on light backgrounds.

### 2.3. Logo Usage

- The official QualifAI Combination Mark (icon + wordmark) must be used in the header. The icon part of the logo can be used as a favicon for the browser tab.
- The "AI" part of the "QualifAI" wordmark should be emphasized, either through a bolder weight or by using the Accent Color (`#00C853`).

### 2.4. General Style

- **UI Elements:** All UI elements, such as buttons and input fields, must have rounded corners to create a modern and friendly look.
- **Iconography:** Icons should be clean, modern, and consistent in style (e.g., line-art style). They should visually represent the associated content effectively.
